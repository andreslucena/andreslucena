### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm AndrÃ©s. I'm a technical consultant and software developer, although lately I don't have much time for writing code. I work making open source with public institutions, organizations and social movements. 

On the last four years I've been mainly busy with [Decidim](https://decidim.org), a web platform for participatory democracy made by Barcelona City Council.
